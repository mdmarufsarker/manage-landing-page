## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` installed on your machine to run the build script.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/maruf-pfc/manage-landing-page.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd manage-landing-page
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Build Script

This project uses Tailwind CSS to compile utility classes from a source file into a final `style.css` file.

To start the build process and watch for any changes you make to the HTML or `tailwind.css` files, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will automatically generate the `style.css` file in the project's root directory. You can then open `index.html` in your browser to see the landing page.
